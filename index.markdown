Welcome!
========

Welcome to ExploitMe Mobile by Security Compass.  This is an open
source project demonstrating iPhone mobile hacking.  We've developed
this set of labs and a exploitable framework for you to hack mobile
application on iPhone.

If you're a developer, you can also gain some great insight on how to
securely develop mobile applications and prevent common programming
pitfalls in iPhone applications. Our labs will help you learn about:

 * Parameter manipulation
 * Encryption
 * Password lock screens
 * File system 
 * Insecure storage
  
You can find all this on our github [link](http://www.github.com/SecurityCompass/iPhoneLabs). 

Not an iPhone fan?  We also have an Android version! Check it out [here](http://securitycompass.github.com/AndroidLabs)!
